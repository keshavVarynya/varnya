            <div className="p-10 pb-0 "><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Hair oiling is one of the oldest tricks in the book for long, healthy, and luscious locks. Even though trends have changed today, oiling used to be a go-to for our grandmothers and
                mothers. With innumerable chemical treatments, including keratin, botox, nanoplasty, and
                whatnot, most people seem to have forgotten the good ol’ oil treatment. </span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Be it excessive heat damage, split ends, or dull tresses, oiling hair never disappoints. In
                addition, environmental factors such as increased pollution and climatic changes highly
                affect hair quality. However, one can easily restore the natural shine and luster of the hair
                by regularly nourishing it with the proper nutrients, and patience, of course! Want
                jaw-droppingly voluminous hair like Rapunzel? Oil it! </span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">One of the fondest childhood memories for most Asians would be their mother oiling their
                hair. Those days and memories just hit differently. Those days might not come back, but
                your pre-chemical hair can. Yes, with the right oil and techniques, you might be able to
                flaunt some real-gorgeous tresses.  </span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Now, if you are reading carefully, you might wonder what we mean by the “right oil”? By
                right, we simply mean pure and unadulterated. Whenever we consume resources in their
                purest form, great results are promised. You can use coconut, almond, sesame, olive, or
                argan oil, just ensure it's untainted.</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Aggressive chemicals and related treatments leave hair brittle and dry. Aside from this,
                your hair will eventually lose its ability to lock natural moisture. You can bid adieu to the
                shine and strength your hair once possessed. Didn’t know better before? It’s alright. Almost
                all chemical-centric treatments, including bleaching, decoloration, smoothening, and
                several others, excessively deplete hair quality. The result of relentless chemical dosage can
                be irreparable damage - one of the most horrid nightmares for a woman. It’s like having a
                bad hair day every day. Don’t worry, you can still reverse the situation.</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">With a balanced and protein-rich diet, you can do wonders for your hair. However, in this
                case, what you apply to your hair is more important. Regular and deep nourishment of the
                scalp and tresses can completely change your hair game. Virgin oils, rich in vitamins A and
                E and antioxidants, can aid by offering much-needed solace to your once-lovely mane. Your
                locks are one of the most eye-catching features. Make sure you hold people’s attention for
                the right reason, that is, incredibly envious hair.</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-normal text-2xl text-neutral-500 tracking-wide blogContent">Here is how virgin oils can up your hair game</span></div>
            <div className="p-5 pb-0 ps-20"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">
                • Deep nourishment and hydration<br></br>
                • Offer essential vitamins and antioxidants <br></br>
                • Leave you with strong and manageable locks<br></br>
                • Reduced scalp irritation and dandruff issues<br></br>
                • Act as a chemical-free conditioner<br></br>
                • Shiny and lustrous hair<br></br>
                • Reverse chemical and heat damage to some extent</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">As mentioned above, you can apply any oil, but all you have to ensure is its quality and
                contents. Now, you might want to run a quick errand to buy olive oil, but it will not be just
                olive oil that you will get - there will be several other oils and elements mixed. The reason
                why we are focusing on oil and its contents, you ask? Our scalp absorbs everything. You
                don’t want just anything to seep inside. Might do more harm than good. The quality of oil is
                what directly impacts hair quality. Additionally, adulterated oil can mess with the pH level
                of your scalp too. Nobody wants to attract attention to brittle tresses.
                So, next time you buy a magic potion for your hair, be sure to flip it and read its ingredients.
                It will only take a minute, come on.
