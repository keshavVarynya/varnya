            <div className="p-10 pb-0 "><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Thinking to yourself if you know exactly what this article is about? Is the topic really giving
it all away? Well, you are right and wrong. This 3-min read focuses on chemical-free facials,
sure, but it also sheds light on numerous other things you might be doing wrong, skin-wise.
Let’s dive deep into it to give you a clearer picture.</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">In the present scenario, skin-care has overtaken makeup and cosmetic beauty treatments.
More and more people seek to invest in branded products to up their skin game, but do
they really know what’s inside those toners, cleansers, or moisturizers? Sure, it feels good
in an instant, but what about the harm? Now you must be thinking - what harm? How can a
cleanser or cream harm me? Well, welcome to the age of ENLIGHTENMENT!!! </span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Gave enough thought to how a product can change your skin tone in a week? How do these
companies CLAIM their products are capable of these? Well, it is time we look up their
ingredients. Just like you read up before buying groceries, why don’t we emphasize the
need to do the same for our skin and hair?</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">All individuals have different ways of unwinding. While some prefer to spend their day off
in the great outdoors, others seek self-pampering. Thankfully, there are a lot of outlets
available for that. A trip to their favorite salon would most definitely top this list. And
nothing says relaxation and leaving your stress behind like a good facial! Your skin is prone
to pollution, heat, dust and at least a minimal makeup routine throughout the week. A
calming and long facial can definitely do the trick. Here’s a question - do you go for
conventional facials or chemical-free ones?</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">We hear chemical-free facials are the one wherein naturally derived ingredients are used in
the products. Sounds better for your skin and health, no? We call this the age of
enlightenment because a larger section is now concerned about what is going on inside
their bodies. It may come as a shock to some, but all major beauty brands use ingredients in
their products that are either unsafe for the human body or the environment. Regardless of
their claims, there have been innumerable instances where toxic chemicals have been found
in the products - sulfates, paraben, phthalates, and lead, to name a few. But there is nothing
that money cannot settle, big or small lawsuits included, right?</span></div>
<div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-normal text-2xl text-cyan-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Why are chemical products yielding results on my skin then?</span></div>

            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Have you ever wondered why your skin glows instantly after a facial? Why is there a world
of difference in your before and after images? There is definitely no magic in the hands of
your esthetician, but it is the ingredients of the products used by them. Just like thenaturally-derived ingredients of chemical-free products take time to develop, so do their
results. While on the other hand, chemical-rich products are quick to yield results and
hence are still widely chosen.</span></div>
<div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">We think it is safe to say that we are living in an age of instant gratification and need
everything instantly, including the glow on our faces. But let’s not be blindsided to the
harmful side-effects of applying chemical additives. Believe us if you will, they aren’t doing
you any good. If aging gracefully is something you seek, you might want to rethink your
choices before it’s too late!</span></div>
<div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Everything you do for your health, skin, hair and body should be an investment rather than
an expense. It is the nature of investments to offer benefits, whether long or short term. To
understand better, let’s look at an instance. If you regularly order junk food, you are adding
to your expenses along with the added health risk. On the contrary, when you eat balanced
meals, rich in fiber, protein and all the required goodness, you are investing in your health
and increasing longevity. Same way, your skin absorbs anything and everything you feed it.</span></div>
<div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Don’t know how to make the switch? Just start by simply ensuring what you eat and what
you apply share a few commonalities. We’re sure there are hardly any chemicals in your
food with weird names and even weirder pronunciations!</span></div>
<div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">Among the countless benefits of using naturally-driven products and ingredients, radiant
skin sort of tops the list. And who doesn’t love blindingly-glowing skin? Just like good food
and water do wonders for your skin, the same way organic products work. The more raw
and familiar-sounding products you apply, the better!</span></div>
            <div className="p-10 pb-0"><span className="font-normal text-2xl text-neutral-500 tracking-wide blogContent">Following below are the reasons why organic products are a godsend for you</span></div>
            <div className="p-5 pb-0 ps-20"><span className="font-extralight leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 tracking-wide blogContent">

                </span></div>
